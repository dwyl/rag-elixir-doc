# rag-elixir-doc

Create a POC of a RAG to help/improve searching in the Elixir/Phoenix/Plug/LiveView documentation.

- which LLM? The base LLM could be ChatGPT 3.5? Ollama? Mistral? Claude 3.5 Sonnet: performance vs costs ðŸ˜¥

- What is our source of knowledge? We can firstly only seed the vector database with some Github raw pages from the Elixir documentation.
  We need to define how to ingest these documents to produce _embeddings_ saved into a _vector database_. Do we run a naive [chunk] or [structured chunks](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/retrievers/auto_vs_recursive_retriever/), [Chunk + Document Hybrid Retrieval](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/retrievers/multi_doc_together_hybrid/), or use [BM25](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/retrievers/bm25_retriever/), with an Elixir implementation [BM25](https://github.com/elliotekj/bm25)? 

- Which embedding? To be defined. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibzlEQmgPPY) uses "GT-SMALL" (from Alibaba).
  The problem could be to be able to use this with Elixir/`Bumblebee.Text`. The list: <https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard>
  
- Which vector database? Postgres with PGVector, or [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase), or [ChromaDB](https://github.com/3zcurdia/chroma)??
  
- Which interface? A very simple one: an input that takes a text, and a textarea where we display the response.

- Which **prompt**? ...

- Next? We can further improve be accepting documents, possibly links serving raw text, but also upload markdown files.

- Deploy this? As a first step, this is a POC, to be run locally.

- Source of inspiration. Repos, blog post?
